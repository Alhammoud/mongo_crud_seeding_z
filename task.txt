Next task:

Wir wollen das betanken der datenbank per script aufrufen.

- Put the seed part in a seperate file seeds.js.

- First find an existing collection. If there are entries present - don't seed - otherwise run the seed script.

- Provide the possibilty to just delete the data. Use a command line flag for it. 

  Eg: the command with the --delete flag node seeds.js --delete and in the code get this flag with: process.argv.includes("--delete")
- Put eveything in a seperated seedfile and run that seed file per npm script. npm run seeds and a seperate delete script npm run seeds:delete (bearbeitet)
